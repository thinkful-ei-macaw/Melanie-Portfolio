           <h1>About Me</h1>
           <p>A little about me? Gosh, where do I start? I am a mother of 4 and LOVE my family. 
            Although I have battled with a few disabilities, I've always loved computers and studying the many different 
            things you can do with them. Becoming a Developer is just another step in my journey to better my career so that I can 
            provide my kids with the best life possible. When I am not working or coding, you can find me goofing off with my kids,
            going on family trips, or simply just binge watching tv shows.

           <p>Title: Test Your Game of Thrones Knowledge
              This is a short quiz for all the my GOT fans.
             I had the pleasure of working on this project with 
            one of my classmates, who is also a GOT fan. It consists of 5 questions 
            one at a time and provides the correct answer if the wrong answer is checked. 
            done using HTML, CSS, javaScript, jQuery and a bit of DOM manipulation. </p>
